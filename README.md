# DSA

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like AlgoExpert and LeetCode, implemented in C++.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and solutions to different coding problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each solution is crafted with efficiency and readability in mind, making use of the power and flexibility of C++.

## Contents

**LeetCode Solutions**: Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized into study plans. I am currently focusing on the "Top 100 Liked Questions" study plan.

**AlgoExpert Solutions**: Solutions to AlgoExpert problems, grouped by category.

Each solution file is named according to the problem it solves, making it easy for you to navigate and find specific solutions.

## How to Use

To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AZ10CA/DSA.git
```

## Contributing
While this is a personal project to track my own learning and progress, I'm open to contributions and suggestions. If you find an error or have a more efficient solution, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
